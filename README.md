# Hello and welcome to my Github profile! 😄👋

My name is Jonathan but, on the web I go by ThatGuyJK. I am a software engineer (a majority of what I do is frontend development) but I have also done work as a professional 3D artist in the past (I am slowly getting back into it). On this page you will find links to various projects I have built as well as some repositories I find highly interesting and informational as a developer!

### Technologies I have used
Below is a list of the various languages and technology I have used throughout my career on different projects, both personal and professional.
- HTML/CSS/Javascript (including Node.js and some Typescript)
- C/C++
- Rust (currently learning)
- Three.js
- Next.js / GatsbyJS
- Smart Contracts w/ Solidity
- Unity
- Blender (current tool I use for 3D modeling and animation)
