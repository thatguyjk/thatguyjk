# Hello and welcome to my Github profile! ðŸ˜„ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jonathan but, on the web I go by ThatGuyJK. I am a software engineer (a majority of what I do is web development) but I have also done work as a professional 3D artist in the past (I am slowly getting back into it). In my Github profile you will find links to various projects I have built as well as some repositories I find highly interesting and informational/inspirational as a developer!
